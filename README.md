Author: Aman Desai

## Introduction

We discuss the use of jupyter notebooks to perform an interactive LHC analysis on HEP MC sample. This will be helpful for educational purposes and introduction to HEP data analysis and/or machine learning in HEP. 


## How to Run the code? 

Download the git repository 

```code
git clone https://github.com/amanmdesai/interactive-hep-analysis.git
```

and open the jupyter notebook.

## Binder Setup 

TBD

## Monte Carlo Sample

The Monte Carlo Sample used for this study maybe obtained from Kaggle's https://www.kaggle.com/c/higgs-boson.
